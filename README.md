# Hangman (Exercise 18)

This is a basic Hangman sim, to play this download the file and enter npm start in the terminal.

I am still learning how to code, the code is very basic. I had to do a lot of research and watch a few videos. 

In this game the player has 11 try's to guess the correct word. The words are dev themed. (For fun).

Once the hangman stick image is fully drawn, the player has lost.
